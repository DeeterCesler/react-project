# Sweater Weather
## an application made with React
This application shows the weather based on whatever location is given by the user

### Features
• The user gives the location via a ZIP code

• The zip code uses one of Google's geocoding APIs to pull latitudinal and longitudinal info

• It then uses latitude and longitude to make a request to Dark Sky's API

• Based on apparent temperature returned from Dark Sky, the application will then render a related weather scenario and describe the location's current weather pattern

• The application will also give a tongue-in-cheek clothing suggestion based on apparent temperature
